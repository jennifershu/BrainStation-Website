	<p id= "paras"> Electronic don't seem to be hazardous when you look at them because of how pretty they look on the outside. The inner part of these devices is the part that poses a threat to our environment. Electronic products are filled with heavy metals, semi-metals and other chemical compounds that can leak into soil and become dangerous. Things like lead, mercury, copper, barium, nickel and even arsenic are all present within a variety of electronic products. As they are being thrown away or placed in the landfills, the products break which can expose the inner workings and those dangerous chemicals and metals.
	</div>
	<div>
	<p id="parass">Many of these chemicals and metals are known causes of serious health conditions like cancer, diabetes, impaired cognitive function, damaged organs and more. This is dangerous to both humans and animals which causes death then leads to less of a  population of both human and animals!
